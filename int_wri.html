          responseA: "Technology has profoundly influenced human life, bringing both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, technology has improved communication dramatically. For instance, smartphones and internet services have enabled instant connectivity across the globe, making it easier for families to stay in touch even when physically apart, and businesses to operate more efficiently across different time zones.\nHowever, there is a downside to this technological advancement. The widespread use of social media and constant connectivity can lead to information overload and increased stress. Many people find themselves unable to disconnect, feeling compelled to check notifications or respond to messages at all hours, which can disrupt sleep patterns and lead to anxiety. The pressure to be available 24/7 and the bombardment of information from various sources can be overwhelming, reducing the quality of personal downtime and affecting mental health.\nThese examples highlight the dual aspects of technology’s impact on our lives, showing how it can both bridge distances and, paradoxically, create barriers to personal well-being.",
